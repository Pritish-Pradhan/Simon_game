# Simon_game
This web game is made using HTML, CSS, and javascript
In Simon game you can start the game using any key press and then by clicking in the same patterns as the buttons flash by you can increase your level.
for ex: In level 1 -> if the red button flashes by then you will move up a level by clicking on the red 
         In level 2 -> if the green button flashes by then you will have first to click the red and then the green button to increase your level. And so on for the subsequent levels.....
         In case, you remembered the pattern wrong then you will have to start over again.
